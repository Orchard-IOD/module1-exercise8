Dice Generator - User Stories

User Story 1:
    As a tabletop gamer,
    I want to be able to access the Dice Generator landing page,
    so that I can add online gaming support to my tabletop gaming activities.

User Story 2:
    As a Dice Generator user,
    I want to be able to select different-sided dice from the application's GUI,
    so that I can match the dice to the dice requirements of the game I am playing.

User Story 3:
    As a Dice Generator user,
    I require the application to generate a random value
    within the minimum and maximum values of the die chosen,
    so that I can simulate accurate dice rolls for the game I am playing.

User Story 4:
    As a Dice Generator user,
    I would like to see additional options, 
    such as setting the number of dice to roll.
    Adding positive or negative modifiers to die rolls,
    so that the outcomes better reflect real gameplay scenarios.
    A future enhancement maybe to allow die selection through icons 
    or visual representations instead of using a standard dropdown menu.
